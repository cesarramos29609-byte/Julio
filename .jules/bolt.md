## 2026-06-24 - Performance Logging Optimization
**Learning:** Frequent file I/O (opening and closing handles) in a logging function can become a significant bottleneck as the application scales. Using a persistent file handle reduces system call overhead.
**Action:** Implement a persistent, lazy-initialized file handle for `performance_log.txt` in `performance.py`.

## 2026-06-25 - Audit Protocol O(1) Optimization
**Learning:** Checking or verifying logs incrementally during status/state updates using internal tracking avoids O(N) list-iteration lookups (like sum generators) on frequent calls, converting O(N) tasks into O(1) operations.
**Action:** Always maintain incremental running statistics or counters within state tracker instances instead of iterating over historical records to generate summaries.

## 2026-06-26 - Circuit Breaker Hot Path Short-Circuiting
**Learning:** Checking for `failures == 0` first in circuit breakers avoids costly float division, string percent formatting, and state dict generation under normal operations, transforming success paths into super fast O(1) operations.
**Action:** Introduce fast paths for read/write checks inside CircuitBreakers when no failures have been encountered.
